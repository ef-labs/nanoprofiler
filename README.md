NanoProfiler
============

NanoProfiler is a light weight profiling library written in C# which requires .NET 4.0+. It was inspired by the MiniProfiler project, but is designed for high performance, big-data analytics, and is easy to be used for both sync & async programming model. It has been used in EF (Education First) projects generating billions of profiling events per day with trivial performance penalty.

NanoProfiler itself implements the core profiling feature and a simple implementation for persisting results via slf4net. If you want better profiling result management feature, you could implement the IProfilingStorage interface by yourself.

NanoProfiler also provides a wonderful view-result Web UI supports view latest profiling results in a tree-timeline view (simply visit ~/nanoprofiler/view in your web application).
